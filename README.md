# MMMCataphote

Limited reflection for Decodable types.

(This is a part of `MMMTemple` suite of iOS libraries we use at [MediaMonks](https://www.mediamonks.com/).)

The main objective for this is to be able to automatically generate lists of object fields and child entities to be
included into responses when working with JSONAPI-style responses.

Limitations:
1) there is very limited support for enum fields (only the ones that can decode from a string "dummy");
2) any dictionary is assumed to have `String` keys, could be resolved by parsing type names;
3) it might not work well with `Decodable`s that use custom initializers.

## Installation

Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/mediamonks/MMMSpecs.git'
source 'https://cdn.cocoapods.org/'
...
pod 'MMMCataphote'
```

SPM:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/mediamonks/MMMCataphote", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.3"))
```


## Usage

A quick example here:

```swift
import MMMCataphote

struct Person: Decodable {
	let id: Int
	let name: String
	let height: Height
}

struct Height: Decodable {
	let height: Double
}

print(MMMCataphote.reflect(Person.self))
```

Prints the following:

```swift
Object(Person) where:

Height:
- height: Double

Person:
- height: Object(Height)
- id: Int
- name: String
```

I.e. the value returned by `MMMCataphote.reflect` can be browsed to automatically build the lists of fields or entities
to include into JSONAPI-like responses, for example.
